            <h1>The Birth of Test Cricket:</h1>
            <p>
              The 19th century witnessed a pivotal moment in cricket's history with the inception of Test cricket.

            <h1>The Emergence of Limited-Overs Cricket:</h1>
            <p>
              While Test cricket flourished, the need for a faster and more spectator-friendly format became evident. Enter the limited-overs cricket, which revolutionized the game in the 1960s. The inaugural One Day International (ODI) took place in 1971 when Australia faced England at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. This format of the game proved to be a massive success, and the Cricket World Cup was born in 1975, adding another dimension to cricket's allure.
